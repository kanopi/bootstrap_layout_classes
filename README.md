# Bootstrap Layout Classes Widget (Kanopi fork)

Provides functionality for editing and rendering Bootstrap layout classes.

Uses a plain text field to store bootstrap layout classes (container, row, col,
margin, padding, gutter, offset, order, align, justify).


## Requirements

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.


## Installation

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. For further
information, see
[Installing Drupal Modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-drupal-modules).


### Composer

If your site is [managed via Composer](https://www.drupal.org/node/2718229),
use Composer to download the module:

```sh
composer require "kanopi/bootstrap_layout_classes"
```


## Configuration

The module has no menu or modifiable settings. The widget can be configured in
each fields display settings.

When the formatter is active for a field the module will prevent the text field
from being rendered and instead outputs the content as classes on the entity.

To get the normal field rendering back, select another formatter in the fields
display settings and clear caches.


### Field

On the desired content or paragraph type create a plain text field (cardinality
of limited 1), e.g. `field_layout`.


### Widget

Set the form display to "Bootstrap Layout Classes" and use the options to choose
 which layout classes to allow.


### Formatter

Set the display to a hidden label and "Bootstrap Layout Classes" formatter.
